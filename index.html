                <p id="p1">My name is Eric Keyes, and I am an aspiring Web Developer. In the time before I was hunched over a dimly lit computer screen typing out code like a caffeine-addled gremlin, I was actually in mobile phone sales management at Best Buy Mobile. If you thought that sounded boring: you are completely correct. Every day consisted of getting up, going to work, and then selling the ideas and creations of others. Don't get me wrong, I was good at it, but I just wanted something more. One day at work, I got an invitation to a conference call. Within minutes, I found out they were closing all the Best Buy Mobile stores.</p>
                <p id="p2">At first, it felt like the end of the world. I had lost a high-paying management job, and retail managers are apparently a dime a dozen. Jokes on them, however, as it turns out my old store closing is probably one of the best things that's ever happened to me. Now I live in Philly and make dope websites like this, what more could you want?</p>
                <p id="p3">Other than that, I enjoy: biking (like apparently everyone in Philadelphia), hiking, video games, listening to music, going to shows, and pretty much every other relatively generic entertainment options available to us in the First World.
